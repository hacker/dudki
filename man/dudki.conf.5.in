.SH NAME

dudki.conf \- The configuration file for the dudki process
monitoring daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS

The dudki.conf file is a runtime configuration file for the dudki
process monitoring daemon. It contains the information about the process
being monitored and the instruction on how to cope with the processes.

.SH FILE FORMAT

The file consist of the global configuration and per-process
configuration sections. The global configuration controls general
dudki behaviour and sets defaults for per-process configuration
directives.

.SH GLOBAL CONFIGURATION

.TP
\fBCheckInterval\fR \fIseconds\fR
Specifies interval in seconds at wich dudki performs checks.
.TP
\fBDaemonize\fR \fIon/off\fR
Specifies whether dudki daemon should fork itself into background.
Normally, you don't want it to run in foreground. Unless you want to run
it from \fIinit(8)\fR process (I've nevetr tried it) via
\fIinittab(5)\fR.
.TP
\fBPidFile\fR \fIfilename\fR
Specifies where to store dudki's process id (default is
/var/run/dudki.pid)
.TP
\fBMailtoHeader\fR \fIheader\fR \fIcontent\fR
Sets global defaults for process section's MailtoHeader directive. See
below.
.TP
\fBNotify\fR \fIschema\fR:\fItarget\fR
Sets global default for per process notification. See below.

.TP
\fB<Process\fR \fIidentifier\fR\fB>\fR
Starts per process configuration section. The process will be referenced
using the short descriptive name specified (for example in email
notifications).

.SH PER-PROCESS CONFIGURATION

Per-process configuration sections specifies the processes to monitor.
And parameters pertaining to the process.

.TP
\fBPidFile\fR \fIfilename\fR
Specifies the file where to fetch process id of the process being
monitored from. The absence of file, as well as the absence of process
specified by the pid stored in the file signifies the process death and
triggers restart.
.TP
\fBProcessName\fR \fIprocess name\fR
Specifies the name of the process. The alternative way to find process if it
doesn't keep pid in the file. Similar to \fBpidof\fR(1).
.TP

Specifies the command to run in order to restart the process.
.TP
\fBUser\fR \fIuser\fR
Specifies the unix user to change to before executing the command

Specifies extra headers to add to mailto: notifications sent by the
dudki daemon. Headers specified in per-process section override the
ones specified globally.A
.TP

to the process. The only schema currently supported is 'mailto:'.
