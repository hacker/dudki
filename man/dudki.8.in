.SH DESCRIPTION

dudki daemon is designed to run in the background and periodically
check if certain processes specified in the configuration file are
running. If a process is detected as dead dudki tries to restart it
using the command line specified in the configuration file and notifies
the specified contact (currently only via email).

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.ie \*[longopt] \fB-f\fR \fIconfigfile\fR, \fB--config=\fR\fIconfigfile\fR
.el \fB-f\fR \fIconfigfile\fR
Specify the configuration file to use (default is
\fI@sysconfdir@/dudki.conf\fR).
.TP
.ie \*[longopt] \fB-k\fR, \fB--kill\fR
.el \fB-k\fR
Stop the running instance by sending the \fBSIGTERM\fR signal. If no process
name specified on the command line, dudki kills his own running instance.
.TP
.ie \*[longopt] \fB-r\fR, \fB--reload\fR
.el \fB-r\fR
Reload the running instance by sending the \fBSIGHUP\fR signal. Like with
\fB-k\fR, if no process name specified on the command line, dudki sends
\fBSIGHUP\fR to his own running instance.
.TP
.ie \*[longopt] \fB-c\fR, \fB--check\fR
.el \fB-c\fR
Check if dudki is running. Exit with non-zero status if not. The same target
rules as in \fB-k\fR and \fB-r\fR apply here.
.TP
.ie \*[longopt] \fB-e\fR, \fB--ensure\fR
.el \fB-e\fR
Ensure that dudki is running. Load, if not. Useful for running as a
cron job once in a while. If the daemon is running runs quietly
providing no output.
.TP
.ie \*[longopt] \fB-t\fR, \fB--test\fR
.el \fB-t\fR
Check the syntax of configuration file and exit.
.TP
.ie \*[longopt] \fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR, \fB--usage\fR
.el \fB-h\fR
Display short usage message and exit.
.TP
.ie \*[longopt] \fB-V\fR, \fB--version\fR
.el \fB-V\fR
Report version and exit.
.TP
.ie \*[longopt] \fB-L\fR, \fB--license\fR
.el \fB-L\fR
Show licensing terms.

.SH EXIT STATUS

Zero in case of success, non-zero otherwise.

.SH FILES
.TP
@sysconfdir@/dudki.conf
Default configuration file.
.TP
/var/run/dudki.pid
Default pid-file for the dudki process.
